        <p>Hello! My name is Imola Jooji, and I am from Abuja, Nigeria. I enjoy reading and watching
            football, and I value spending quality time with my family whenever I can. I love
            meeting new people, exploring new ideas, and trying out new things. I have a strong
            passion for farming and find great joy in watching things grow and develop. I also enjoy
            learning new skills and expanding my knowledge. As an entrepreneur, I am driven by
            curiosity, growth, and the desire to create meaningful opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/nigerian-flag.jpg" alt="The Nigerian Flag" width="200">
        <p>Nigeria stands tall as Africa's vibrant powerhouse—rightfully earning the title "The
            Giant of Africa." With the continent's largest population and economy, Nigeria is a land
            of breathtaking contrasts, from the rolling Mambilla Mountains to the golden sands of
            Lekki's beaches. Blessed with abundant natural resources—oil, gas, and rich mineral
            deposits—the nation has fueled rapid infrastructure growth and continues to shape
            Africa's economic future. But Nigeria's influence goes far beyond its borders. Home to
            Nollywood, one of the world's largest film industries, and the birthplace of Afrobeats,
            Nigeria exports culture, creativity, and rhythm across the globe. At the heart of it all
            are 230 million resilient, innovative people—driving progress, shaping trends, and
            inspiring the world. Nigeria is not just Africa's giant; it is Africa's future.</p>
